                        ADDITIONAL TERMS
              Pursuant to Section 7 of the LGPL-3.0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In addition to the terms of the LGPL-3.0, the following additional 
terms apply to your use of AppLib:

1. NON-COMPETE RESTRICTION

   You may NOT use, modify, copy, or distribute this software, in 
   whole or in part, to create, develop, market, or contribute to 
   any software product that:

   (a) Is a user interface framework, toolkit, widget library, 
       component library, or application development framework; AND

   (b) Provides substantially similar functionality to AppLib 
       (including but not limited to: UI components, layout systems,
       or desktop application development tools); AND

   (c) Is distributed to or made available to third parties, whether 
       commercially, freely, or as open source.

2. WHAT THIS RESTRICTION DOES NOT APPLY TO

   This non-compete restriction explicitly DOES NOT apply to:

   (a) Applications - You may build any application (commercial, 
       proprietary, or open source) using AppLib without restriction.

   (b) Internal Use - You may modify AppLib for your own internal 
       applications without distributing those modifications.

   (c) Plugins & Extensions - You may create and distribute plugins, 
       themes, extensions, or add-ons that extend AppLib's 
       functionality.

   (d) Complementary Tools - You may create tools that work alongside 
       AppLib (such as design tools, code generators, or debugging 
       utilities) as long as they do not replace AppLib's core 
       functionality.

   (e) Contributions - You may contribute modifications back to the 
       official AppLib project.

   (f) Forks for Personal Use - You may fork AppLib for personal, 
       non-distributed use.

3. ATTRIBUTION

   If you distribute applications built with AppLib, you must include 
   attribution to AppLib in your application's "About" section, 
   documentation, or credits. A simple "Built with AppLib" notice 
   with a link to the project is sufficient.

4. SCOPE OF MODIFICATIONS

   As required by the LGPL-3.0, if you modify AppLib itself and 
   distribute those modifications (either standalone or as part of 
   an application), you must make the source code of your 
   modifications available under this same license.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                       COMMERCIAL LICENSE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A Commercial License is available for organizations that:

- Prefer not to comply with the LGPL-3.0 copyleft requirements 
  (e.g., want to keep AppLib modifications proprietary)
- Want additional support, warranties, or indemnification
- Require different licensing terms for legal/compliance reasons
- Want access to enterprise features or priority support
