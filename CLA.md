# AppLib Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AppLib. This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to AppLib.

## Why a CLA?

AppLib uses a dual-licensing model (LGPL-3.0 with Additional Terms for open source, plus commercial licenses). To maintain this model and protect both the project and our users, we need to ensure we have the necessary rights to all contributions.

## Agreement

By submitting a Contribution to this project, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to AppLib for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by AppLib. This includes any communication sent to the project maintainers, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

**"Submitted"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the project, including but not limited to communication on mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to AppLib and to recipients of software distributed by AppLib a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
- License Your Contributions under any license, including but not limited to:
  - The LGPL-3.0 with Additional Terms (open source license)
  - Commercial/proprietary licenses
  - Any future license the project may adopt

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to AppLib and to recipients of software distributed by AppLib a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

### 4. Representations

You represent that:

- **You are legally entitled to grant the above license.** If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to AppLib, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with AppLib.

- **Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.** You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

- **Your Contribution does not include any third-party code** unless you have clearly identified such code and its license in your Contribution.

### 5. Support and Warranties

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 6. Notification

You agree to notify AppLib of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

### 7. Moral Rights

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You hereby waive, and agree not to assert, any moral rights You may have in or relating to Your Contributions.
